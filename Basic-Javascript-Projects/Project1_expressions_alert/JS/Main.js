//This is hoe you write an alert box. This will create a seperate pop-up box with an okay button. There are two ways to write this. 
alert("I swear on my pretty Floral Bonnet I Will End You!");

//And this is another way you can write it. Also if you want to add two strings together (Concatenate) you can add the (+) between the two strings. 
window.alert("\"Do you know what the chain of command is?  " + "It's the chain i go get and beat you with until you understand who's in ruttin' command.\"");
var Sent1 = "This is the begining of the string...  ", Sent2 = "and this is the end of the string." //this is creating mulitiple variables.

document.write (Sent1 + Sent2);//this is an expression telling the program to write the value of variables Sent1 and Sent2 which will result in a concatenated string.
