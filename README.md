### Calculator

 This was a fun project to see if I could create a working calculator using Javascript. This is a fully functioning calculator with all working operators  + - * / and = buttons, so users can Add, subtract, multiply, and divide to their hearts content.

 
 
 
 
### Lone Elk Lodge Website

 This is the home page to a little website I am working on for a beautiful Lodge in Glacier National Park. In this project I wanted to include a smooth scrolling effect, working slideshow, and a popup contact form using JavaScript. Eventually all nav buttons will connect to different pages as well as VRBO to book your stay. This is just to get the styling of the page to look engaging.

 



### Pizza Project
 
  This fun little mock website uses Javascript to make a working menu selection. Users can pick this size and toppings and get to see the total price when they place an order. 
  
  
  
  
### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Want to play a game? Here is a fun Halloween themed Tic-Tac-Toe game where you must outsmart...a very dimwitted computer. Ok Yes I made it easy to win, but you will certainly enjoy the fun sounds and colorful playing tokens  in the fully functional game.
